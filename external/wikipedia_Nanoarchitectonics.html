        Nanoarchitectonics in biology: self-assembly of lipids (a), proteins (b), and (c) SDS-cyclodextrin complexes.
        SDS is a surfactant with a hydrocarbon tail (yellow) and a SO4 head (blue and red), while cyclodextrin is a
        saccharide ring (green C and red O atoms).

        Nanoarchitectonics in chemistry: transmembrane chloride channel formed by self-assembly of fumaramides
        Nanoarchitectonics is a technology allowing to arrange nano-sized structural units, usually a group of atoms or
        molecules, in an intended configuration. It employs two major processes: nano-creation and nano-organization.
        Nano-organization involves re-arrangement of the structural units in a desired pattern, while nano-creation is
        synthesis of new materials that do not exist in nature. For example, by peeling atomic sheets off graphite slab,
        a novel nano-material graphene can be obtained, which has very different properties from graphite.
        <br>
        Nanoarchitectonics is not limited to nano-creation and nano-organization, but rather employs those techniques to
        understand and use the ultimate functions of materials. The important technologies to achieve this goal involve
        manipulation of single atoms and molecules through physical interactions, chemical reactions, applied fields, or
        self-assembly.
